# Errata for *Machine Learning Using R*

There are some inconsistencies in the file paths given in the book. For consistency with the code download, use the following format:

`"<your local path>\Dataset\Chapter #"` 

For example, on page 34, 

Change `read.csv("employees.csv", header =TRUE, sep =",")`
To `read.csv("<your local path>\Dataset\Chapter 2\employees.csv", header =TRUE, sep =",")`

Similar changes apply to the following pages:

Page 42, 47, 52, 132, 134, 135, 137, 138, 140, 141, 143, 144, 146, 147, 148, 153, 155, 157, 160, 161, 163, 169, 171, 173, 174, 236, 269, 296, 339, 367, 384, 397, 419, 472, 485, 499, 511, 524.
